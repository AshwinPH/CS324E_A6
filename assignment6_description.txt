The best way to put it is that this simulation (rudimentarily) depicts life. We were inspired by Conway's Game of Life to simulate a set of particles that live, die, get diseases, recover, and break down walls according to a set of rules.


Abi wrote the Plague class. This class simulates a non-deadly but highly contagious disease. It starts with one infected cell who infects all of its neighbors. The rule is that any infected cell will infect all of its living neighbors—with one exception. At every round, a medic (instantiated by the Plague class)  teleports somewhere on the screen. Everywhere the medic goes, it heals all of its infected neighbors. Cells healed by the medic then gain immunity to the disease. One expected challenge met by Abi was that she initially intended for the medic to move around less liberally (say one or two spaces over). But if that were the case, then all of the cells would very quickly become infected and the game wouldn’t be interesting. That inspired her to create a teleporting medic. Another challenge was thinking about how to implement the grid update. Since it would be costly to have every member’s class running various update methods with for loops, Abi decided to write a function into the parent cell class that automatically updated a cells neighbors according to its given parameters, which are which of cell’s ought to be changed in the next round, as well as what they should be changed to. Her thinking was that other members could reuse this function, so that this function could be called multiple times for different reasons in a single for loop.
